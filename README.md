### Questions and brief description of the application

#### What will the application do?
The application will be used to reinforce the memorization of things that will be important in the study or work life
by helping the user create flashcards. The flashcards will be stored in the subjects under the dividers which will help 
the user compart relevant cards together (for instance, different terms (using divider) and within a term, 
the different courses (using subject). The application will also show the user the date added, and the last date 
read, allowing the user to see which flashcard they have **most likely** forgot by then. The user can also 
sort the flashcards by the added or last opened date so that the user can see which card they will want to 
review **most.**

#### Who will use it?
Mainly students who have to *memorize* and *learn* the materials from their studies (for eg, medical students)
and even workers whose jobs require them to *memorize* could benefit from this app 
(for instance, waiters who would like to memorize the restaurant menus). 
**Anyone** who has a lot of items to *memorize* will find the app useful. 

#### Why is this project of interest to you?
This project interests me because as a student I have to *memorize* a lot of materials especially when I am taking 
biology and organic chemistry classes. This app could help me with my study and since I created this app,
I could also add some features or functions of personal needs, so I could use it more effectively and 
other users could also benefit from it.
